## My process

### Built with

- React framework (including useState, useContext, useEffect) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- CSS Modules – For scoped, maintainable styling
- Flexbox & CSS Grid – For layout and responsive design
- Custom Hooks – For better code organization
- Mobile-First Workflow – Ensures a great user experience across devices

### What I learned

- CSS Best Practices: Gained a deeper understanding of how to effectively use Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive design
- React State Management: Learned how to use useContext for global state management, improving app structure and scalability
- API Integration: Enhanced my skills in fetching and managing data from external APIs
- Dark/Light Mode: Developed an efficient approach for implementing a color theme switcher, allowing users to toggle between dark and light modes seamlessly
- Code Refactoring: Refined my code organization and structure, making it more modular and easier to maintain

### Continued Development

I plan to continue improving this project by adding more features like:
- A search suggestion feature
- Implementing pagination or infinite scrolling for faster loading times
- Further refactoring the code for better performance and scalability
- Implementing unit and integration tests using Jest or React Testing Library
