## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables, SCSS - CSS extension, custom, data attributes
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Handling errors appropriately
- Refined, different syntactical aproaches to solving problems
- Accessibility aspect deep-dive
- New CSS approaches to gaining better control over certain HTML elements and their positioning concerning responsive design
- Deeper understanding and reasoning behind adopting more flexible ways to build certain parts of the application
- Clean, efficient way to define theme patterns and using them over the app in a simplest way having best practices in mind
- Refined aproach to refactoring the code using best practices

### Continued development

- Will focus mostly on refining React skills, alongside Next technologies, sometimes building same apps I built using Vanilla JS to gain better perspective of their advantages and different aproaches and staying up to date with cutting-edge technologies
